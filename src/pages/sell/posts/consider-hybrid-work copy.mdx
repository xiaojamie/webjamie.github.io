# Chienhsuan Hsiao's Ceramic 

## Artistic Statement

I am asking: Who am I? This encompasses various aspects such as my personality, values, culture, and identity. During this challenging period of high school, I faced conflicts and struggles. The events that happened every day shaped and changed me. My work evolved in thought over time. I believe that identity is an ever-evolving process. I associate birds with freedom, the body with strength, and flowers with romantic relationships and a sense of tranquility. The deliberate cracks and textures symbolize mistakes, and these mistakes are not only okay but beautiful: this is a process of growth and self-acceptance.

This was not only my first time practicing on the pottery wheel, but also my first time trying various methods to create flowers. Initially, I used tools like rolling pins to strive for perfection and delicacy. But later, I found that pressing clay sheets by hand and shaping them into unique curves achieved the ideal thinness. Each petal has its own personality. I also pressed clay onto different fabrics to experiment with different textures. The textures varied depending on the type and size of the linen or synthetic fiber cloth used. I intentionally made many mistakes, symbolizing growth and acceptance.

## Artworks

### 1. Bird of Freedom

This piece depicts a bird, symbolizing freedom. The bird's form and posture convey a sense of lightness and ease. The natural texture of the clay and the deliberate cracks give the bird more vitality, as if it is flying with a longing and pursuit of freedom.

### 2. morifolium Vase

This vase is one of my first attempts on the pottery wheel. The vase is adorned with delicate flowers, each petal handmade with unique curves and textures. The cracks on the vase not only do not destroy its beauty but add a sense of natural, imperfect beauty, symbolizing mistakes and acceptance in the process of growth.

### 3. Flower Vessel

This piece showcases a Flower, symbolizing romance and tranquility. The rose petals are made by hand-pressing clay sheets, with their thinness and curves demonstrating a soft and delicate texture. Each petal has a unique texture, symbolizing the unique personality and experiences of each individual.
