# Chienhsuan Hsiao's Ceramic

## Artistic Statement

I am asking: Who am I? This encompasses various aspects such as my personality, values, culture, and identity. During this challenging period of high school, I faced conflicts and struggles. The events that happened every day shaped and changed me. My work evolved in thought over time. I believe that identity is an ever-evolving process. I associate birds with freedom, the body with strength, and flowers with romantic relationships and a sense of tranquility. The deliberate cracks and textures symbolize mistakes, and these mistakes are not only okay but beautiful: this is a process of growth and self-acceptance.

This was not only my first time practicing on the pottery wheel, but also my first time trying various methods to create flowers. Initially, I used tools like rolling pins to strive for perfection and delicacy. But later, I found that pressing clay sheets by hand and shaping them into unique curves achieved the ideal thinness. Each petal has its own personality. I also pressed clay onto different fabrics to experiment with different textures. The textures varied depending on the type and size of the linen or synthetic fiber cloth used. I intentionally made many mistakes, symbolizing growth and acceptance.
