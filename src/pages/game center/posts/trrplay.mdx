Code structure
Trigger uses JavaScript on both the client and server.

All code now lives under server/.
Client-only code is in server/public/scripts/
Shared code is in server/shared/

On the server, we use the node.js module system ('require').
Run server/build/build.sh to build production-mode JS bundles.
