  "readme": "# `@astrojs/parser`\n\n> ⚠️ **Notice** `@astrojs/parser` has been deprecated. In previous versions of `astro` it was responsible for parsing `.astro` files. `astro` has since adopted the brand new [`@astrojs/compiler`](https://github.com/withastro/compiler).\n\nThis directory is a fork of `svelte/compiler`. It is meant to stay as close to the original source as possible, so that upstream changes are easy to integrate. Everything svelte-specific and unrelated to parsing (compiler, preprocess, etc) has been removed.\n"
